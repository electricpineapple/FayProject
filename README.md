# Notes
I implemented as close to spec as I saw (I would welcome collaboration with design on any critiques).
I made some notes as to what I would change along the way. Some of those I implemented later as needed.
There are some notes on changing the token to include a refresh token and expiration dates.
While not flashy, I added the ability to relaunch the app and for it to remember the user via token in the keychain.
